My brother has a great blog called [Technology and Learning](http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning) over at Inside Higher Ed. For whatever reason (eyeballs on ads?), Inside Higher Ed has decided to not put the full text of his posts in the official [RSS feed](http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/feed/Technology%20and%20Learning).

This is a quick-and-dirty [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) app that takes the official RSS feed and adds in full post content so you can read his blog in an RSS reader like a gentleman.

This app deploys to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) as-is and runs for free.

(p.s. If ad revenue is the issue here, I'd be thrilled to use an official Inside Higher Ed RSS feed that offered full posts with inline ads or sponsored posts.)
